## What is the project (non-technical description)?
The aim of this project is to create a web application for users to monitor their dietary needs and prevent the consumption of any food that triggers the user's allergy. We do this by collecting data about the user's diet, and their allergy, then using text recognition, scan and monitor the ingredients in their foods to make recommendations on their next grocery or food consumption. (based on the allergy and safety of the food).

## What is the need for this project, impact, benefits?  What is the impact if this project doesn't get built?
Many people buy and consume foods that have some harmful hidden ingredients. Being able to monitor what you eat and keep track of those hidden ingredients used by food producers can have a beneficial impact on millions of people. It can save money and life. Researchers found out that food allergies cost about $25 billion each year and estimated that 32 million Americans have food allergies, including 5.6 million children under age 18. That’s one in 13 children, or roughly two in every classroom. The impact of not having this project for use, is the suffering of those people and the huge amount of money spent each year battling this preventable issue.

## Who will use the output of this project?
Can be used by people that have allergies, or someone shopping for ingredients that don't want to include food that can cause allergies, Or even people who would want to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

## The resources you will need, human, machine, other?
Human and machines will be needed
We can use Tesseract OCR, an open-source engine that can recognize text in multiple languages.	https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/05/build-your-own-ocr-google-tesseract-opencv/

## What process/methodology will you use?
We are using the agile method of organizing and keeping track of the teams progress. Besides the once a week meetings on the thursday's, we plan on doing additional scrum meetings to help each other out and keep a more consitent track of the team's progress as a whole.

## What is the schedule for the project and it's milestones?
Besides having the iteration dates as milestones, we want to assign each person 1 task to complete each week, and when the time comes for our main scrum meetings, have completed that assigned task.
